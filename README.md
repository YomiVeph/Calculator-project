    ## Project Structure
- `index.html` – calculator layout and display  
- `styles.css` – UI styling  
- `script.js` – calculator logic and event handling

## What I Learned
- Handling user input with JavaScript
- Using DOM manipulation to update the display and history
- Writing clean logic for calculations
- Replacing UI with JS logic instead of displaying(Math.PI() it'll show pi sign)
- Managing application state (current input, result, history)

## Future Improvements
- Dark mode
- Better mobile layout
- More scientific functions
- Save calculation history
